## What is Traffic Cop?

Traffic Cop provides an opportunity for those new to Cyber Defense to explore what bad traffic looks like in a way which is engaging and educational without being too punishing.

In our game, users are presented with several different kinds of network attacks. Within these attacks, called "levels'' there are individual pieces of traffic called "cards." Each card represents an individual piece of network traffic. The goal of the game is to assess whether each of these individual pieces of traffic should be rejected and which could be accepted. All of the cards for each level have something to do with the attack, but the goal is to identify which pieces of traffic achieve some rung on the Cyber Defense Kill Chain

 Each level has a description of the attack which provides background on what's happening during each attack. This includes what type of attack is being carried out, some descriptions of the attack patterns, and even some diagrams showing the progression the attacker has to follow in order to achieve their goals. The option to view this information is present to the user throughout the level, so anytime they get something wrong they can examine the description again to guide their future decision.

## How do I play Traffic Cop?

Traffic Cop is a basic system involving one primary html file called "index.html" which constructs the game and displays all the information. In order to play the game, simply run the html file in your browser of choice.
